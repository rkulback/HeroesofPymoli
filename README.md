# HeroesofPymoli

This project analyzes the purchasing and demographic data for Heroes of Pymoli. The data allows for certain conclusions
and patterns to be identifies, in order to further capture market share in the free-to-play gaming sector. 

Three observable trends/conclusions to be drawn from the study. 

1. The 15-24 age demographic represents the largest player base. The overall average spent per player is relatively close
between age groups. However, the 15-24 age player base is significantly larger than the other age brackets. 

2. The female player base represents a huge growth opportunity. As its stands, males represent the primary user base for Heroes
of Pymoli. Females are willing to spend, on average per player, more than males. Any increase in the female player base
could yield increased revenues. Studies and surveys would benefit how we can adapt the game to appeal to female players.

3. The 35-39 player base is willing to spend more on the game. While the 15-24 age demographic is the largest player base, 
there are other demographics of the player base who are willing to spend more on a per player basis. In order to achieve
increased revenues, efforts should be made to increase these player bases as they have demonstrated an increased
willingness to spend disposable income on the game. 

More recommendations can be made as requested.
